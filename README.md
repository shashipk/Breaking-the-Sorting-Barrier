# Breaking the Sorting Barrier for Directed Single-Source Shortest Paths

Dijkstra's Dethroned After 41 Years: The Breakthrough Algorithm
Yes, this is real! Researchers from Tsinghua University have achieved the first major breakthrough in shortest-path algorithms since 1984, breaking Dijkstra's "sorting barrier" with a new deterministic O(m log^(2/3) n) time algorithm. This landmark achievement won the Best Paper Award at STOC 2025.

The Breakthrough Explained
What Was the "Sorting Barrier"?
For 41 years, computer scientists believed that any shortest-path algorithm faster than Dijkstra's O(m + n log n) was impossible because finding shortest paths seemed to require sorting vertices by distanceâ€”and sorting fundamentally takes O(n log n) time. This became known as the "sorting barrier."

Key Innovation: 

No More Full Sorting: The new algorithm breaks this barrier by avoiding complete sorting of vertices. Instead, it:

- Uses recursive clustering to group neighboring frontier vertices
- Combines Dijkstra's and Bellman-Ford approaches intelligently
- Processes vertices in batches rather than individually
- Maintains partial ordering instead of complete sorting
